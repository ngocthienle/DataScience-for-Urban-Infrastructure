# Some Useful Resources for self-learning SimPy and NetworkX Python Libraries

This document outlines useful resources for learning two important Python libraries.

---

## 1. SimPy learning resources

- **Youtube channels:** Ideal if you have multiple dependencies including C libraries (e.g., geopandas, PyPSA). It uses YAML files.


- **Study links:** Great for pure Python projects and when you want lightweight environments using a `requirements.txt` file.

## 2. NetworkX learning resources

- **Youtube channels:** Ideal if you have multiple dependencies including C libraries (e.g., geopandas, PyPSA). It uses YAML files.
